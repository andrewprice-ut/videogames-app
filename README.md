##Project Title: What Defines A "Good" Videogame?

##Project Description:
For this project we want to use an analysis of videogame sales and reviews to determine common traits of a "good" videogame. We also hope to utilize machine learning to predict what the next "good" game will be, looking at things like genre, publisher, and gaming platform.
